THE BATTERY
Huft Vape batteries come with an on/off safety lock feature.  When you receive your kit, the battery will typically be turned off.  To turn the battery on simply key the button 5 times and the button will flash, indicating the battery is on.  Should you choose to turn it off, key the button 5 times and the battery will flash indicating it's turned off.  The battery does not need to be turned off for charging.

The Huft battery button has three color LED capabilities (white, blue, and red) for indicating battery level. 

A white button indicates a battery level between  50%-100%.
A blue button indicates a battery level between 2%-50%.
A red button indicates a battery level between 0-2%.

Do not leave your Huft battery charging unattended. The typical charge time for a battery is 2-4 hours. The usb charger is compatible with car adapters and computers for your convenience.

FILLING AND VAPING
Remember, that this is NOT a tobacco cigarette.  You don't draw on it as you would a cigarette.  You want to take it easy on the pull, draw long and slow, pull the vapor into your mouth before you inhale.
Keep your atomizer filler wet, add a few drops of juice regularly to keep atomizer coil and wicks moist. We suggest filling to 1.5 ml, not all the way up to 2ml.  If you detect a burnt taste, top off your cart with your liquid or wax of choice. When using a cartridge that contains liquids, be sure to regularly check the battery contact to the cartridge. Some cartridges have small amounts of liquid seep through to the battery and this should be cleaned with a qtip to ensure that there is no battery damage. 

FUNNEL CARTRIDGE
The funnel cartridge is meant for any oils or waxes thicker than standard e cig liquid. It is important to keep in mind that the thin heating element coils should never be touched by ANYTHING. These coils are what users tend to damage most often when using thicker oils. There are several methods of applying thicker oils to the funnel cartridge without coming into contact with the heating element. The two main methods are by melting the oils on to the coil using heat and by using the supplied tool to drop the oil as close to the coil as possible without touching the heating element.
